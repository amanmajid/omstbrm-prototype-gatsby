    "description": "Data is the foundation of robust decision-making. As part of our transboundary work in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, we are collating data sets, building data platforms, and developing a suite of decision-models. Explore the platforms below.\nOur suite of data sets focus on the electricity and water sectors of Israel, Palestine and Jordan. These data feed into data platforms that could help regional decision-makers to understand the transboundary dynamics of their system. For example, users can visualise the energy and water sectors are a system scale, track the impacts of socioeconomic and environmental drivers, and examine risks and opportunities associated with transboundary issues."
